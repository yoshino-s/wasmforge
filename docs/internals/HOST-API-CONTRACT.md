# wasmforge Host API Contract

This document is the source of truth for `env.*` imports exposed to WASM.
Adding a new export requires adding a row here with rationale, classified
under one of categories A/B/C below. Category D ("Unjustified") is a CI failure.

The contract is CI-enforced by `internal/hostmod/contract_test.go`.

## Categories

- **A. Foundation primitive** — generic dispatch / memory / handle operations
  that nothing higher up can replicate. Examples: `mod_invoke`, `mem_alloc`,
  `mod_hread`. WASM cannot do these.
- **B. OS proxy** — direct syscall passthrough where the OS API has no
  equivalent representation inside the WASM sandbox. Examples: `sock_open`,
  `fd_open`, `os_hostname`, `darwin_call`. WASM cannot reach the kernel
  on its own.
- **C. Atomic composite (host-thread-affinity)** — a multi-step Win32 dance
  that legitimately needs host thread/process state (SYSTEM impersonation,
  COM STA-thread affinity, or both). Examples: `lsa_kerbop`. Cannot be
  replicated by `wf_call` chains in WASM.
- **D. Unjustified** — should be migrated to WASM via `wf_call`. CI fails
  if anything in this category lands.

## NativeAOT-WASI active surface (Rubeus / Seatbelt path)

Functions registered in `internal/hostmod/nativeaot.go` and exercised by
the Rubeus/Seatbelt parity test suite. Probe-verified against Rubeus.wasm.

| Canonical (Go-side) | Anonymized (WASM import) | Category | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| win32_syscalln | mod_invoke | A | Generic wf_call dispatch — foundation |
| win32_load_library | mod_load | A | DLL loading — foundation |
| win32_get_proc_address | mod_resolve | A | Symbol resolution — foundation |
| win32_host_read_bytes | mod_hread | A | Cross-boundary memory read — foundation |
| win32_register_funcptr | mod_regptr | A | Callback infrastructure — foundation |
| win32_lsa_kerberos_op | lsa_kerbop | C | SYSTEM impersonation + COM STA + LSA on same thread; cannot reproduce via wf_call chains in WASM |
| win32_crypto_op | xc_op | C | Generic crypto dispatcher. Runs the iteration loop of MS-PBKDF2 (Windows DPAPI master-key derivation), RFC PBKDF2, HMAC, plain hash, and AES-CBC host-side via BCrypt. The in-bridge alternative (looping `wf_call` per HMAC) costs ~32k wf_calls per master key (~40 min); the dispatcher is one wf_call per derivation. Designed as the **landing pad for future complex/looped crypto** so we don't grow the host export surface per new primitive. Opcode catalog: sha1/sha256/sha512, hmac1/256/512, pbkdf2_1/256/512, mspbkdf2_1/mspbkdf2_512, aescbcdec |
| win32_io_op | xi_op | B | Generic IO dispatcher. Sibling to xc_op for filesystem operations. Replaces the 6-8 wf_call CreateFile+ReadFile+CloseHandle chain in `fs_read_all` (~46ms per file) with a single host trip via Go's `os.ReadFile` (~<1ms per file). Opcode catalog: read, stat, list. Same wire format as xc_op (opcode string + length-prefixed packed byte fields). Future filesystem ops add opcodes, not exports. |
| win32_reg_search | reg_search | C | Host-side BFS walker for SharpDPAPI's `search` verb. Walks the supplied hive enumerating every value and matches against SharpDPAPI's DPAPI provider GUID + 4 base64/hex string signatures. Doing this in WASM costs ~4 wf_calls per visited key × ~500K HKLM keys → exceeds the lab's 5-minute exec timeout. Host-side BFS uses parent-handle propagation at native Win32 speed (`RegOpenKeyEx(parent, child, …)` — no full-path lookup per key) and completes both hives in seconds. Wire format: NUL-separated UTF-8 records, first record is the "Root:" line matching native FindRegistryBlobs |
| win32_dpapi_backupkey | dpapi_bkey | C | Host-side DsGetDcNameW + LsaOpenPolicy + 2× LsaRetrievePrivateData chain for SharpDPAPI's `backupkey` verb. DsGetDcName writes a `DOMAIN_CONTROLLER_INFOW*` (host pointer) to its OUT param; LsaRetrievePrivateData writes a `LSA_UNICODE_STRING*` (host pointer) whose Buffer field is also a host pointer. wasm32 C# would truncate both via Marshal.PtrToStructure on a 32-bit IntPtr → OOB trap. Single wf_call returns the materialised DC FQDN + 16-byte preferred-key GUID + raw key blob; C# assembles the kirbi (PVK wrapping + base64). Wire format: packed (status u32, dc_name length-prefixed, guid length-prefixed, key_blob length-prefixed) |
| win32_x509_match | x509_match | C | Host-side X.509 store walker for SharpDPAPI's `machinetriage` cert-matching path. Native walks `CurrentUser\MY` + `LocalMachine\MY` then for each cert calls `cert.PublicKey.Key.ToXmlString` (System.Security.Cryptography PNS on NativeAOT-WASI) to compare against a private-key XML derived from the decrypted blob. The bridge takes raw big-endian RSA modulus bytes (extracted by manual byte slicing on the C# side — no crypto calls), walks both stores via `CertEnumCertificatesInStore`, parses each cert's SubjectPublicKeyInfo via `crypto/x509`, compares moduli, and on match returns packed metadata (thumbprint, issuer, subject, dates, EKUs, cert DER) for C# to format the multi-line output + PEM-wrap. Wire format: status u32, then on match 7 length-prefixed records |
| win32_virtual_alloc | mem_alloc | A | Host memory allocation — foundation |
| win32_virtual_free | mem_free | A | Host memory free — foundation |
| win32_hmem_read | mem_read | A | Cross-boundary memory read — foundation |
| win32_hmem_write | mem_write | A | Cross-boundary memory write — foundation |
| win32_hmem_write32 | mem_write32 | A | Cross-boundary u32 write — foundation |
| win32_hmem_write64 | mem_write64 | A | Cross-boundary u64 write — foundation |
| win32_hmem_addr | mem_addr | A | Host VA retrieval — foundation |
| win32_wmi_query_restricted | wmi_query_r | C | Atomic WMI query for restricted namespaces (root\SecurityCenter2, ROOT\Subscription) that fire IUnknown auth callbacks during ConnectServer. The host implementation calls CoSetProxyBlanket and runs the entire IWbemServices chain on a COM STA thread so callbacks never cross the WASM FFI boundary. Seatbelt AntiVirus and WMIEventConsumer parity require this; cannot trivially replicate in WASM-side wf_call chains |

Registered in `internal/hostmod/module.go`, `tcp.go`, `udp.go`, `io.go`,
`dns.go`, `sockopt.go`. Used by all WASM targets (Go and NativeAOT alike).

| raw_sock_recv | fd_raw_recv | B | Raw packet receive |

---

## Foundation primitives — OS proxies (all targets)

Registered in `internal/hostmod/os_host.go` and `os_exec.go`.

| os_chdir | sys_chdir | B | chdir — host working directory change |
| os_user_current | sys_user | B | getpwuid / GetCurrentUser — not available in WASM |
| os_getpid | sys_pid | B | getpid — WASI has no process ID concept |

| os_start_process | proc_start | B | Non-blocking process start |
| os_wait4 | proc_wait | B | Wait for child process completion |

Registered in `internal/hostmod/pipe.go`.

| Canonical (Go-side) | Anonymized (WASM import) | Category | Rationale |

| os_pipe | fd_pipe | B | Host pipe pair creation — os.Pipe() returns ENOSYS on wasip1 |
| pipe_read | fd_pread | B | Read from host pipe |
| pipe_write | fd_pwrite | B | Write to host pipe |
| pipe_close | fd_pclose | B | Close host pipe |

## Retired / out-of-scope re-migration candidates

These functions appeared in nativeaot.go's earlier registration but were
removed because the C# side migrated to WASM-side wf_call chains:

| Former canonical | Former anonymized | Removed in | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| win32_wmi_query | wmi_query | Phase B | WASM-side stub |
| win32_wmi_method | wmi_method | Phase B | WASM-side stub |
| win32_get_sddl | (none) | Phase B | WASM-side via wf_call |
| win32_enum_user_rights | (none) | Phase B | WASM-side stub |
| win32_enum_rpc_endpoints | (none) | Phase B | WASM-side stub |
| win32_enum_network_adapters | (none) | Phase B | WASM-side via wf_call |
| win32_get_file_version_info | (none) | Phase B | WASM-side via wf_call |
| win32_enum_reg_values | (none) | Phase B | WASM-side via wf_call (advapi32) |
| win32_parse_sddl_acl | (none) | Phase B | WASM-side passthrough |
| win32_reg_enum_key (nativeaot path) | (none) | Phase B | WASM-side via wf_call |

If a future feature exercises any of these, the migration follows the Phase 2
pattern: write the WASM-side pinvoke_env_ext.c replacement, remove the
`import_module` attribute in `wf_bridge.h`, retire the Go-side Export.
